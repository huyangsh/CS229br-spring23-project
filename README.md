# CS229br-spring23-project

This repository contains Yang Hu's course project for CS229br (Spring'23).

+ The project paper can be found at `./paper/paper.pdf`.
+ To run the simulation in the IPD game setting, execute `python ./PD_simulator.py`.
+ To run the simulation in the IBC game setting, execute `python ./mono_simulator.py`.

The code is programmed in a modularized way:

+ `./game/` contains the definition of game classes `MatrixGame` and `MonopolyGame`.
+ `./player/` contains the definition of different agents.
+ `./utils/` provides utilities for plotting and data processing.

Finally, thanks all of you for your efforts in this wonderful course!
